# ECS Cluster setup
## Terraform
This is a terraform template and requires to be run by terraform plan/apply.
[Download Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html)

### States
We now use an s3 bucket to store current infrastructure states. You can use the state-cfg.sh script to setup with the octanner s3 bucket.  Otherwise use the configuration below.

```bash
./state-cfg.sh d1
```
[terraform state info](https://www.terraform.io/docs/state/remote/s3.html)

```bash
terraform remote config \
-backend=s3 \
-backend-config="bucket=mah_bucket" \
-backend-config="key=datacenter/d1/<repo>/terraform.tfstate" \
-backend-config="region=us-west-2"
```
Once the backend has been connected too, your local state will be located in *./.terraform/terraform.tfstate*

Please sync with
```bash
terraform remote pull
```

Push changes with 
```bash
terraform remote push
```
##### Note: You must use the state files, otherwise you will overwrite the current state, and or create duplicate resources.
